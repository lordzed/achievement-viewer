# Steam Achievement Viewer

A beautiful web-based viewer for your Steam achievements, powered by GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Fork this Repository
Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your forked repository's **Settings**
2. Click **Pages** in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**
4. Under "Branch", select **main** (or **master**) and **/ (root)**
5. Click **Save**
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

Your site will be available at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`

### 3. Get Your Steam API Key (Optional but Recommended)
1. Go to https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
2. Enter any domain name (e.g., `localhost`)
3. Agree to terms and copy your API key

### 4. Add GitHub Secret (Optional but Recommended)
1. In your repository, go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Add: `STEAM_API_KEY` with your Steam API key as the value

**Note:** The API key is only needed if you want the workflow to automatically fetch game data. If you're manually uploading achievement files, you can skip this step.

### 5. Add Your Achievement Files

#### Option A: Manual Upload (No API Key Needed)
1. Create folder structure: `AppID/[game-app-id]/achievements.json`
2. Example: `AppID/730/achievements.json` for Counter-Strike 2
3. Upload your achievement JSON files from your Steam emulator
4. Commit and push to your repository
5. Your site will update automatically!

#### Option B: Automatic Fetch (Requires API Key)
1. Add `STEAM_API_KEY` to repository secrets (see step 4)
2. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run daily
3. Or manually trigger it: **Actions** tab → **Fetch Steam Game Data** → **Run workflow**
4. The workflow will:
   - Fetch game information from Steam
   - Download achievement data and icons
   - Scrape hidden achievement descriptions from public profiles
   - Generate `game-info.json` for each game
   - Create `game-data.json` with all data

### 6. Achievement JSON Format

Your `achievements.json` should look like this:
```json
{
  "achievements": {
    "ACH_WIN_100": {
      "name": "Winner",
      "description": "Win 100 games",
      "earned": true,
      "earned_time": 1678901234,
      "icon": "https://...",
      "icon_gray": "https://..."
    },
    "ACH_LOSE_1": {
      "name": "First Loss",
      "description": "Lose your first game",
      "earned": false,
      "earned_time": 0
    }
  }
}
```

**Fields:**
- `earned`: `true` if unlocked, `false` if locked
- `earned_time`: Unix timestamp when unlocked (0 if locked)
- `icon` and `icon_gray`: URLs to achievement icons (optional, workflow can fetch these)

### 7. Verify It's Working
Visit your GitHub Pages URL and you should see your achievement viewer!

## 📊 What You Need vs What's Optional

### Required (Minimum Setup):
✅ `index.html` (this file)
✅ `AppID/[game-id]/achievements.json` files with your achievement data
✅ GitHub Pages enabled

### Optional (Enhanced Features):
⭐ `STEAM_API_KEY` secret → Enables automatic game info fetching
⭐ GitHub Actions workflow → Auto-updates game data daily
⭐ `game-info.json` files → Auto-generated, contains game names/icons/rarity
⭐ `game-data.json` → Auto-generated, combined data file

**You can use this viewer with JUST the achievements.json files!** The workflow is optional for enhanced features.

## 📝 Notes

- Your GitHub Pages site is public by default
- The workflow uses public Steam profiles to find hidden achievement descriptions
- No personal Steam account needed - just upload your achievement files
- The viewer works offline after initial load

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**No games showing?**
- Check that your `AppID/*/achievements.json` files exist
- Verify the JSON files are valid (use a JSON validator)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

**Games show but no names/icons?**
- This is normal without the workflow
- Either: (1) Add `STEAM_API_KEY` and run workflow, or (2) Manually create `game-info.json` files

**Profile picture not showing?**
- Falls back to default Steam logo if GitHub avatar unavailable
- Check that your GitHub profile is public

**Hidden achievements show "Hidden achievement"?**
- Without workflow: Expected, descriptions aren't in your achievement files
- With workflow: May not find all descriptions, depends on public profile availability

**Workflow not running?**
- Check that `STEAM_API_KEY` is added to repository secrets
- Verify the workflow file exists at `.github/workflows/fetch-game-data.yml`
- Check Actions tab for error messages
