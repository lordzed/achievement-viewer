#### Supported Formats (only one is needed per game)

##### GBE fork achievement JSON Format

By default they are stored in: `%AppData%\GSE Saves\{AppID}`
Your `achievements.json` should look like this:

```json
{
  "Defeat_Mantis": {
    "earned": true,
    "earned_time": 1754144765
  },
  "Obtain_Archetype": {
    "earned": true,
    "earned_time": 1754144765
  }
}
```

##### Steam cached Achievement Watcher {AppID}.db files

By default they are stored in: `%AppData%\Achievement Watcher\steam_cache\data`
and/or `%AppData%\Achievement Watcher\steam_cache\user\{SteamID}\`

Your `{AppID}.db` should look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "apiname": "ACHIEVEMENT_reached_speed_1",
    "achieved": 0,
    "unlocktime": 0
  },
  {
    "apiname": "ACHIEVEMENT_spam_obstacles",
    "achieved": 0,
    "unlocktime": 0
  }
]
```

### 6. Verify It's Working

Visit your GitHub Pages URL and you should see your achievement viewer!

The only important thing in the user branch below is the AppID folder, inside that the game's Steam AppID folder, inside that "Your achievement data".
All other files are optional or auto-generated.

## 📊 What You Need vs What's Optional

### Required (Minimum Setup):

✅ `index.html` (this file)
✅ `AppID/[Steam AppID]/achievements.json` files with your achievement data
✅ GitHub Pages enabled

### Optional (Enhanced Features):

⭐ `STEAM_API_KEY` secret → Enables automatic game info fetching
⭐ GitHub Actions workflow → Auto-updates game data daily
⭐ `game-info.json` files → Auto-generated, contains game names/icons/rarity
⭐ `game-data.json` → Auto-generated, combines all achievements data from [Steam AppID] folders

**You can use this viewer with JUST the achievements.json files!** The workflow is optional for enhanced features.

## 📝 Notes

- Your GitHub Pages site is public by default
- The workflow uses public Steam profiles to find hidden achievement descriptions
- No personal Steam account needed - just upload your achievement files
- The viewer works offline after initial load

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**No games showing?**

- Check that your `AppID/*/` folder has any supported format achievement data files as mentioned in the `Supported Formats` section.
- Verify the files are valid (use a json or db etc. validator, depending on the file)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

**Games show but no names/icons?**

- This is normal without the workflow
- Either: (1) Add `STEAM_API_KEY` and run workflow, or (2) Manually create `game-info.json` files

**Profile picture not showing?**

- Falls back to default Steam logo if GitHub avatar unavailable
- Check that your GitHub profile is public

**Hidden achievements show "Hidden achievement"?**

- Without workflow: Expected, descriptions aren't in your achievement files
- With workflow: May not find all descriptions, depends on public profile availability

**Workflow not running?**

- Check that `STEAM_API_KEY` is added to repository secrets
- Verify the workflow file exists at `.github/workflows/fetch-game-data.yml`
- Check Actions tab for error messages

At first this was made for GBE fork users.

Implemented and automatized the logic behind **alex47exe**'s gse_fork_tools for hidden achievement retrieval.
